# Welcome to Mendeler, where you can grow peas just like Mendel

This mini game highlights inheritance patterns for monogenic traits. Navigate to the game page to choose which peas to cross and see how appearance and genes are distributed among the progeny peas. Continue breeding, or add new gines from the pear available in the sidebar.

For simplicity a very limited munber of traits are available, including color, overall shape and surface texture.
