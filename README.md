# Welcome to Mendeler, where you can grow peas just like Mendel

This mini game highlights inheritance patterns for monogenic traits. Navigate to the game page to choose which peas to cross and see how appearance and genes are distributed among the progeny peas. Continue breeding by crossing two of the children or add new genes to the mix by choosing to include a new pea available in the sidebar.

For simplicity a very limited number of traits are available, including color, overall shape and surface texture.
In order to display the inheritance patterns, the present alleles are visible both in the image of each pea and aas a text where dominant traits are represented by upper case letters and recessive traits by lower case letters.

#### [View the demonstration application here](https://teresebo.github.io/mendeler/)

## Getting started
Navigate to the link above and try it out. 
For continued development, first clone the repository from gitHub: 
```git clone https://github.com/TereseBo/mendeler.git```

Then navigate to the project folder:  
```cd baddle```  

To install requirements run:  
```npm i ```  

## Environment
The application does not require any additional sign-ups or registrations but relies on react-gh-pages for it's deployment.

## Testing
Testing has not been implemented beyond having a run command:
```npm run test```

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information on implementing testing.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
